### Overview.
Vision Racing is a game that depends solely on one's computer camera and their ability to use the position of their head to steer. The game was designed to be a fun and interactive game that people could play at anytime. The game is almost entirely hands free and gives the user the ability to test their ability to steer using their head.

### Game Design
This game utilizes Open Computer Vision, OpenCV, which is a Python library that uses the camera to capture in real time what the camera sees in order to be used in different methods. In this game, OpenCV is used as the controller of the racers using facial recognition. We use OpenCV to track the x coordinates of one's face within te camera frame which is then used to steer the car.

### Maps and Racing
When the game code is ran, one can choose to create their own map or use one already uploaded. If one chooses to upload a map, the game will automatically start up the camera in order to take a picture of the drawn/created map and convert it to black and white. From there the map will be a part of the game and allow you to use the new map at any time. This allows the game to continuously grow and gives the user the ability to create their own experience and difficult map if they choose.
