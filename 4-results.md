# Results

Our finalized program is a videogame that uses OpenCV as the controller, has two type of AI Opponents, and is easily modified, as displayed in the image above. The red car is the Center of Mass (COM) AI, and the window in which it evaluates the road as well as the center of mass calculated are illustrated. The COM AI is steering towards the red dot in front of it. The green car is the line AI, and the lines it calculates are displayed, the longest of which is thicker. The Line AI steers in the direction of the longest line. Through play testing, we found that the Line AI works better and races faster than the COM AI.
