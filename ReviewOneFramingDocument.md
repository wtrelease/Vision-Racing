# Architecture Review \#1

#### Background and Context
We aim to create a Mario Kart style racing game which uses OpenCV for control inputs and has AI driven computer players to race against. Our MVP is a playable game in which you can navigate around a course and avoid simple obstacles. We hope to also implement AI racers to play against, and will add additional and more complex game elements as time permits.

#### Key Questions
- How to implement AI racers?
- How to change AI difficulty
- How to implement multiplayer
- What would the best form of control input
- General issues identified with code architecture

#### Agenda
- Run through code structure and classes to implement
- Explain in more depth ideas around AI's
