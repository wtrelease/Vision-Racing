# Architecture Review Reflection \#1

#### Feedback and Decisions
Based on the feedback we received, we know that people want the game to be both funny to play yet challenging. We plan on using the comments on the different kind of movements people are interested to use such as arm movements and moving their entire bodies.

Right now we are not sure which direction we plan on going when developing multiple screen or randomizing obstacles, but a lot of the things people offered as help was useful like the idea of using the Python library: Random to randomize how the obstacles would appear.


#### Review Process Reflection

Overall the review went well, we got lots of input on the questions we were trying to focus on, and will likely be able to use some of it going forward. We provided a good amount of context for overall feedback on what people thought would make the game enjoyable, however diving in to specific technically challenges has mixed success, partially because we havenâ€™t gotten far enough in the project to have run into specific issues. For the next technical review, we anticipate having more specific questions that will generate feedback that is more detailed about our code and not about the game overall.
