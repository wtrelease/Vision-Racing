# Architecture Review Reflection \#1

#### Feedback and Decisions


Based on the feedback we received, we plan to modify our working OpenCV controller to track whole body movements and potentially to track in two dimensions. In other words, we plan on building our controller so that it relies on the x coordinates of the individual to steer left or right and then potentially the y coordinates controls the acceleration. Not many questions generate from this new method other than how do we get OpenCV to track each component then use those to control the game.

We also will review our methods of AI, as we got some useful feedback so to which methods will be attainable and which are outside the scope of this project. We learned one preferable style that may be easier than the other, but it would not provide as fun of a competition as we desire.

#### Review Process Reflection


Overall the review went well, we got lots of input on the questions we were trying to focus on, and will likely be able to use some of it going forward. We provided a good amount of context about where we are in creating our game, and we received some useful information and thoughts about both AI and OpenCV. Unfortunately, we were not far enough into writing the AI algorithms to give very specific questions about it, but the feedback we received was very useful.

We were able to stay on time for the review while also having extra time to get more questions into the discussion that helped with other parts of the game. The pacing made this review go very well and very constructive for us.
