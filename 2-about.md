# Vision Racing

### Description
Computer vision racing game for final project of Olin College Software Design Spring 2018. The racing game utilizes OpenCV both for map creation and movement control, and incorporates AI through virtual opponents. The game was created with the intention of making the player look as ridiculous as possible through the motions used to control the movement of the car.

### Usage
To run the game, run the file racing_game.py, and answer the question, “Would you like to capture a new map?” Responding no to this question will result in a selection of pre-existing maps to choose from. Responding yes to this question will activate your webcam, expecting to see a drawing of a map that it will convert into a virtual map to race on. It will then list available maps and you can choose one by typing the name without a file extension at which point the game will begin, and the cars can be controlled via arrow keys.
