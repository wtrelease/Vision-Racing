# Story


Vision Racing originated with a simple idea: to create a game that forces the player to look as ridiculous as possible. Using an OpenCV controller for the game, many silly movements could be used to utilize the controller, such as leaning side to side, waving arms, or tilting head. Beyond the controller method, we aimed to structure the program in a way that allows us to easily change its features.
