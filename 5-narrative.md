# Story

## Initial Idea
Vision Racing originated with a simple idea: to create a game that forces the player to look as ridiculous as possible. Using an OpenCV controller for the game, many silly movements could be used to utilize the controller, such as leaning side to side, waving arms, or tilting head. During our first architectural review, our peers provided a lot of feedback on our controller ideas and expressed new ideas, such as speed being controlled the volume of the player's 'vroom' sound. Ideation for this aspect of the game was quite fun and creative. 

## Enabling Easy Modifications
Beyond the controller method, we aimed to structure the program in a way that allows us to easily change its features. We kept this in mind as we began writing the program. The controller method and AI methods can be easily changed, as can the geometric structure of the game. Interactive objects could easily be added to the game.

## Play Testing
